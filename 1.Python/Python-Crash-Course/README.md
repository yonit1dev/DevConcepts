# The Python Crash Course Book - Eric Matthes

This book is a very good start to anyone wanting to learing python. With detailed explanation, exercises and projects, it is able to give a grip of basic python programming to any beginner. I highly recommend it to anyone starting off their programming journey.

This directory contains some notes, exercise solution and projects that were included in the book.
