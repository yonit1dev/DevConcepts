# Part I - Basics

This part includes the basics of python.
The module introduces readers to various fundamental programming concepts such as:
	1. Variables,
	2. Data-types,
	3. Conditionals,
	4. Loops, etc... and so much more.

In addition, some built-in python datastructures such as lists, sets, tuples are given brief explanations.

Towards the end of the chapter, you get a hand of taking user-input, functions and classes, file manipulation, and the cornerstone of any software engineer - testing.

I've included some examples from each chapter in the part and done more than 85% of the exercises.

N.B. : Exercises are done with only the scope of the active chapters. There are better, simple and optimized ways to complete each exercise, however, I chose to only complete assumming I only have the knowledge of the previous chapter.
Also, I've added a lot of comments to make sure you partly understand my way of thinking while I was solving each exercise.

If you do find any mistakes or errors in the code, feel free to create an issue.
