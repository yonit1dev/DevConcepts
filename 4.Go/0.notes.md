## Basics of Go

- Go is a low-level static-typed language.

### Packages

- Every go file starts with package name to while it belongs to.

- Two types of packages:

  - Executable: generates a file that's executable.
  - Reusable: helpers / libraries to integrate with our own code.

### Strings and Runes

- Go uses UTF-8 encoding.
- Text is represented using the rune type - similar to char in C.
- Rune represents an alias for int32.
- String stores multiple runes. They're just an array of bytes.
- Iterating over strings, is just iterating over bytes of the string.
- Strings are not null terminated.

### Functions

- Same as in most staticly typed language, parameters need types and return type is required.
- One function can have multiple return values.
