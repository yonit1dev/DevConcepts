## Advanced Function

### Pure Function

- A function for a given argument outputs the same output.
- Doesn't have side-effects; nothing is changed outside the function.

### Impure function

- They have side-effects on other places of code or on their input.

### Pure vs Impure

- Always try to make functions pure, since they are predictable. Logical code mostly produces pure functions.

### Factory functions

- A function that produces another function.
- Refer to functions.js script for more.

### Closure

- Every function in JS is a closure.
- Every function has its own lexical environment. 

- When a function created, the function creates a new lexical environment and registers all variables it has access to inside the lexical environment.
