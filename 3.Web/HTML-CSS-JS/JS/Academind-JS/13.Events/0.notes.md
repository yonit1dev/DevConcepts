## Events in JS

### What are Events?

- Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are programming, which the system tells you about so your code can react to them.

### Listening to / Removing Events

- Refer to the events.js file for how it's implemented.
- The elegant way of listening to events is just by using the addEventListener method provided on HTMLElements.

* When removing event listeners, the binded function should be named functions. Binding arguments / this to a function which is added to an event won't work upon removing event listeners.

### Event Object

- Refer to the events.js file for how it's implemented.

* Target property is useful for interacting with the element on which the event is associated.

### Bubbling & Capturing

- Capturing : browser looks up for event listeners starting from the parent element of a nested element. It then triggers that event before moving upon any nested elements.

- Bubbling : is basically the opposite of capturing. Most browsers by default follow this method where the event in the nested element is triggered first.

- To prevent event triggering due to bubbling or capturing on nested or parent elements, use the stopPropagation method on the event object.
