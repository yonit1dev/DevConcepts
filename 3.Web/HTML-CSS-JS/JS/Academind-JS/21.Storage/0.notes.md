## Browser Storage

### localStorage and sessionStorage

- simple key-value stores. Basically a js file / object.
- Used to store user preferences / small user-data.
- Can only be manipulated by the user and JS.
- For quite simple storages only.
- Difference between localStorage and sessionStorage, is the latter is only stored in the browser for the current session / tab opened. Once the connection / session is closed, the data stored is removed.

### Cookies

- Also simple key-value stores with some configuration options.
- Manage user prefernces, small user-data.
- Can only be manipulated by the user and JS.
- A little more versatile, quite clunky.
- Can be read by the server, unlike localStorage and sessionStorage.
- set the max-age flag to set an expiration for the cookie.

### IndexedDB

- Client-side database built-in the browser.
- Manage complex data.
- Good performance.
