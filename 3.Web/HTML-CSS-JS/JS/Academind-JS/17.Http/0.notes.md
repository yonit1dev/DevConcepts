## HTTP Methods

- HTTP requests / responses are used to communicate between client-side and server-side programs. They expose different methods that enable client-side scripts access to different end-points on the server.
- Some http methods:

  - GET: retrieve data.
  - POST: create data.
  - PATCH: update existing data.
  - PUT: update(override) existing data.
  - DELETE: delete data.

- HTTP methods also include additional data, such as: url, headers, body, etc.

### How to send HTTP requests

- All browsers have a built-in class/object called XMLHTTPRequest, that is used to initate and send requests to a server.
- Response data is usually in JSON format.
- Refer to http.js file for how requests are sent and data is parsed(line 9 - 21).
