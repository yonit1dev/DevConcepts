## HTTP Methods

- HTTP requests / responses are used to communicate between client-side and server-side programs. They expose different methods that enable client-side scripts access to different end-points on the server.
- Some http methods:

  - GET: retrieve data.
  - POST: create data.
  - PATCH: update existing data.
  - PUT: update(override) existing data.
  - DELETE: delete data.

- HTTP methods also include additional data, such as: url, headers, body, etc.
