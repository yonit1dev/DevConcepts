## Numbers

### Behaviors of Numbers

- Every number is a float in JS.
- They're stored in 64bits floating points; one bit is to represent the sign of the number.
- This storage method is the limitation of storing numbers in JS.

- When representing decimal numbers, there is no perfect binary representation of numbers, whic yields imprecise results
- Ex:

  - 0.2 + 0.4 in decimal system yields 0.6
  - 0.2 + 0.4 in binary system yields 0.6000000000000001

  ### BigInt Type

- Primitive data type that surpasses the normal range of floating point numbers.
- Simply add n at the end of numbers to declare BigInt type.
- It's only integers.
- It can't be computed with normal numbers unless converted.
