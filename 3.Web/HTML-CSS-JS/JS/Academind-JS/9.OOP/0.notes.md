## Object Oriented Programming

- What is OOP?
- What are Classes and Objects?
- Inheritance, Polymorphism...etc.

### What is OOP?

- A way of working with real-life entities in programs.
- Refer to the demo folder in this module, for applicable examples and explanations.

### Classes and Instances

- Classes : Models / Blue-prints for objects. The make object creation and recreations easy.
- Refer to demo folder in this module.
- Instances : An object instantiated / created from a class.

### Static / Instance - Properties, Fields & Methods

- Static - accessible on the the class itself, without instantiating an object. Used for global configurations, helper classes. Defined using the 'static' keyword.
- Instance - the usual properties, fields & methods. Instantiated with objects that work with different data.

### Inheritance

- A base class that holds some properties / methods which will be shared among other classes that are based upon this base class.
- Is handy for DRY code.
- You can only inherit from one class in JS.
