## Asynchronous Code

### JS Execution

- JS is a single-threaded language.
- Execution of code is in sequence in one thread, not through multiple threads / processes.
- One execution blocks / interrupts another execution until the former is complete.

- The solution is to handoff longer tasks / code to the browser, since the browser can utilize multi-threading for code execution.
- Call-back function are used for the browser to communicate to the original code after it has executed the longer operation.
